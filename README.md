## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I appreciate those who make it possible to host HTML pages at no cost.  I've been using Wordpress to [blog about travels and hikes](https://yetanotherwebsite.wordpress.com/).  I often include interactive maps that show the track of our hikes, but Wordpress doesn't allow me to upload the HTML pages that contain the maps.  That's where GitHub comes in.  I host the map pages here and then just include a link to them on my blog.

I'll also take this opportunity to promote the free resources at [GPSVisualizer](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/).  Using a GPS file that I create while hiking, it is easy to upload the file to the GPSVisualizer site where a couple of mouse clicks will produce an HTML map file that I can then save and download.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bjregan77/bjregan77.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
